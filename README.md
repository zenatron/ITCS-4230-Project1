# Ravager Revenge
Created by ByteBattalion

## INSTRUCTIONS
Players will use the basic WASD control scheme to move around the game world.  Other important controls include pressing the E button close to an NPC to interact with them and pressing the Enter key to go through their messages, and using the mouse to aim your gun and shoot bullets using the left mouse button. 

Game starts after the main menu and story screen are displayed for the player. At the very beginning, there is an NPC in view. Though they are optional as there is no direct reward, the placement encourages the player to start various battle-based missions that add difficulty.  There are three NPCs in total, each of them requesting that the player defeat a certain number of a specific species of Ravager.   

There are a variety of enemies that randomly spawn throughout the level.  The most basic enemies are the Ravager Crawlers, who patrol the land but will hone in on you should you get too close, dealing a decent chunk of damage (10 dmg).  Ravager Spitters stay in place, however will fire their own bullets at the player if they approach their territory.  They do slightly less damage than the Crawlers, but the projectiles present their own challenge (10 dmg).  Finally, Ravager Burners are dangerous creatures that will continuously spawn massive volleys of flames when provoked (20 dmg).  Fortunately, there are health power-ups (player has 300 health) that also spawn randomly throughout the level that considerably heals the player upon pickup.

The player must search for 3 fragments of The Artifact, a sound emitter that will drive away the Ravagers once and for all.  Each spawner takes a couple of bullets to destroy, upon which the piece will spawn in a random location close to where the spawner stood.  To effectively collect all of the pieces, a great strategy would be to both constantly move around and constantly be aware of your surroundings to avoid taking too much damage.  Firing bullets as often as possible also aids in defeating enemies before posing a threat.

Once the player collects all 3 artifact pieces that spawn during the main level, the player now has access to fight the boss, the Elite Ravager, in the next level, which is unlocked at the bottom left corner exit. Elite Ravager has 3 total attack phases that are indicated by health bar color (boss has 1000 health). Phase 1 includes following a set path while spawning minions to damage the player directly (20 dmg); the boss cannot take damage if any minions are alive. The second phase consists of the boss moving towards the player while using an acidic attack that burns the player's bullets (and destroys them), slows the player down while colliding, and damages the player (30 dmg). These acid puddles are spawned consistently, so players must move. The third and final phase increases the speed of the boss as it starts to chase the player (50 dmg).

Once the boss is defeated, it drops the final artifact piece for the player to collect and unlocks the city center to the right of the boss’ spawn point, where if the player has all 4 artifact pieces which are visible at the bottom right of the screen, approach the tower and interact with ‘E’, the artifact is combined and plays a sound, then the player wins and the screen displays a final game over (good ending) prompt.
