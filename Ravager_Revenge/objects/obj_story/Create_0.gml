paragraph_1 = "You are on the outskirts of a nearly abandoned town where creatures called 'Ravagers' roam the lands and wreak havoc amongst the innocent people of the Earth. " +
	"These creatures roamed once before in an age known as the 'Desolate Times' where chaos was witnessed in every corner of the world and Ravagers feasted until there was no more prey left. " +
	"With the imbalance of nature, the world would be reborn as all of the Ravagers were captured in thick sheets of ice and kept dormant for over a millennia. " +
	"Humankind was able to slowly repopulate and increase their knowledge of the world around them. " +
	"They were soon able to harness the power of energy to use in their everyday lives such as lights and heat. " +
	"As their greed got the better of them, they unintentionally caused the ice to melt, releasing the evil monsters that caused destruction thousands of years ago."
			
paragraph_2 = "In present times, you are on your way to save your little brother Coda, the only family you have left. " +
	"Legend has it that the ancient people who survived the onslaught of attacks during the 'Desolate Times' had found a way to temporarily ward off the evil creatures by using sound. " +
	"The goal for you is to combine the pieces of the Artifact which will drive away all of the Ravagers with the most unbearable frequency for their kind.";

paragraph_3 = "How do you get the Artifact pieces? " + 
	"Destroy the 3 spawner objects that will continuously spawn ravagers intended to kill you. " +
	"But be careful-- there might be some civilians around that need help. " +
	"If you destroy all spawners and the enemies that follow, you may not fulfill their requests. " +
	"Each of the spawners will drop ONE artifact piece. " +
	"The final piece must be obtained by successfully defeating the Elite Ravager who controls them all who will wait for you past the exit of the town, the other side at which you arrived.";

paragraph_4 = "When all pieces are gathered at the tower past the Elite Ravager, place the Artifact pieces onto the pedestals, and save humanity. " +
	"That is your only chance of getting Coda back.";

 paragraph_5 = "Remember, be on the lookout for folks, spawners, and health drops along your journey!";
